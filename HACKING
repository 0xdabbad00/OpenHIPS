Technical Notes about OpenHIPS
------------------------------
--[ Design
Basic goal is to run inside a process we want to protect and then watch 
for exploit attempts and block. Get inside the process via AppInit_Dll 
to give "firststage" execution.  This then determines if we should run 
there, and if we should then protector (ohipsp) gets loaded.

Components:
* monitor (ohipsm*.exe): Makes sure the necessary AppInit_Dll and related reg
	values are set.
* firststage (ohipsfs*.dll): Loaded into every process via AppInit_DLL and
	determines if this process should be protected.
* protector (ohipsp*.dll): Loaded by firststage into processes we want to
	protect.

--[ Debug output
Debug releases display output that is visible in debuggers or  DbgView 
from SysInternals.

Internet Explorer and some other products will create two process (a parent 
and child) with the child being a "sandbox" that runs at low integrity levels.
If you attempt to see debug messages in DbgView you will need to first set
the integrity level of dbgview with:
icacls dbgview.exe /setintegritylevel low
You can confirm the integrity levels by looking in Process Explorer.


--[ Why AppInit_DLL?
I want a DLL loaded into any instances of Internet Explorer, Adobe Acrobat, 
FireFox, and some other processes.  The common way of doing this is to
use the AppInit_DLL registry value.  There are concerns with this method, 
specifically the post "AppInit_DLLs should be renamed 
Deadlock_Or_Crash_Randomly_DLLs" at
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/13/6648400.aspx, and 
the doc "AppInit DLLs in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 - 4" which 
states "Because AppInit DLLs are loaded very early during process 
initialization, they should use only APIs that are exported from 
kernel32.dll in their initialization routines."

LoadDLLViaAppInit from Didier Stevens at 
http://blog.didierstevens.com/2009/12/23/loaddllviaappinit/
implements this.

Also, with AppInit_Dll, you may need to set additional registry keys.  These
are all in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT \CurrentVersion\Windows
- LoadAppInit_DLLs (REG_DWORD): Set to 1 to enable
- AppInit_DLLs (REG_SZ): space or comma separated list of DLL paths with 
	short names.
- RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs (REG_DWORD): Set to 0 to load any DLLs
